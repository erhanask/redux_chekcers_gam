### Personal Note
This was most bored project of my software developing hobby. Also I get a very important thing about my choice on software developing. I do not like to code game or I didn't loved doing it with javascript. I didn't feel enjoyed after like 30m i spent on this project and I don't like the code I wrote in this project. I just code for just finish this thing. If you read this I just wanted to describe if codes are complicated to someone who inspected codes of this project.
